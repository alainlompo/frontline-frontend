<h3>Html 5 is a lot about semantic...</h3>

The <pre><aside></pre> element for example will allow you to define a separate section of a page (by separate we mean that it is not in the main content section of the page). <br/>
The gmail contextual advertisement illustrates this. Or imagine a financial news magazine, the main content deals with certain technical topics and you want to give the reader
an opportunity to dig deeper in some of the aspects, yet you could not develop more inside the main article: this would be a good opportunity to have use the <aside> tag and tell
more about that particular detail to the reader.
