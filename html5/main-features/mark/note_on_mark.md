<h3>A quick note on the mark tag</h3>
<br/>
The <b>mark</b> tag litteraly marks an element or a part of your text, with the idea that it should be highlighted in some way. A classic example is that of the search results on a web page: each occurence found in the text would be highlighted (text made bold with a different color or italic, ...). Another example would be a code editor in which every key word of the language gets highlighted. So we can use mark in both cases.
