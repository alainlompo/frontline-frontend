<h3>Geocoding with mapzen</h3>
<br/>

mapzen is a cool geographic service powered by open source tools and open data. It access is based on the common pattern of using an API Key, which can be obtained
on <a href='https://mapzen.com/developers'>the developers web site</a> after you authenticate using your github account.

Mapzen search uses geocoding via natural language inputs to find particular places (using names, landmarks, businesses) and translate it into geographical coordinates
Mapzen has also some reverse geocoding features that transform some geographical coordinate (longitude and latitude) into a list of places.
